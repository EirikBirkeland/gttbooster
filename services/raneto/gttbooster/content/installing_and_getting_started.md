    <img class="cth-zoom-on-hover cth-separate-image" src="/images/installation_and_getting_started/eula.png"> ___You

<br><u><h3>**__Actual usage__**</h3></u>

We encourage you to try out every button in the toolbar â€“ each button can be hovered to display a tooltip for a quick indication of what the button does. If you want more information, please quickly search this knowledge base for the feature in question, and get in touch if you cannot find an answer immediately! We are always seeking to improve the documentation and to further make obvious usage of the various features.

Instead of searching through the articles, you may also click some of the individual buttons below to see the documentation for what each button does:

<div id="TitleIcons">Placeholder</div>
<br/><br/><br/>
<div id="Toolbar">Placeholder</div>

<script>
    $(document).ready(function () {

    });
