Thank you for your support!

At present, we are considering the addition of other features as well. Please do let us know by e-mail if there is something in particular you would like us to prioritize.

- **High priority:** Support for adding custom dictionary files, including MS Word .dic

- **More segment filtering options:**
    * segment length
    * alphabetically
    * according to whether translated/100%/ICE/etc.

- **Simplified placeholder handling:** let's make it as easy as possible to insert placeholders!

- **Support for multiple custom QA spreadsheets:**
    * Some users may wish to combine several separate workbooks. Please let us know if needed.

- **Convert placeholders into placeholder entities (similar to Trados/MemoQ/MemSource).**

- **An autoreplace feature with custom lists:**  For example, you can choose to automatically substitute a word for another. This way you can enforce certain rules in your translations. An example of this would be to convert <code>8 PM</code> into <code>20:00</code>, or for example changing the British word "normalise" into the American spelling "normalize".



- **Support for Xbench checklists and/or lists from other software.**

- **Adding RegEx support to source/target filtering.**

- **Extending the features in the separate glossary window, and adding those features to the default glossary view as well.**

- **Color themes for the GTT UI**

- **Sorting of lists alphabetically**: e.g. "France, Germany, England" would become "England, France, germany".

- **Quick-insert feature for special symbols (customizable)**

- **Stripping of all placeholders from translated segment**

- **Improving highlighting for client feedback (LQA) to be easier to read**

- **Cross-document consistency check:**
Ability to check all documents in a single project at the same time for any segment-level translation inconsistencies.

- **Status syncing for the GTT inbox: [legacy demo]**

- **Improved timer function:**
* Automatic pausing when user is inactive or using other windows.
* Adding a GUI
* Local logging for personal timekeeping
