The goal of GTT Booster is to be the *best possible companion for GTT* – and we wish to continue improving our offering for several years to come.

We are planning to offer this software on a monthly or annual subscription. The reasons for preferring this model are as follows:

* The software will be kept up to date and in sync with any new developments
* You, as a subscriber,  will be able to communicate with us directly and influence the direction of the tools
    * Really want a particular feature...? You will be able to vote on your favorites.
    * Or perhaps your particular language needs special adjustments? If you can explain to us the linguistic* sides of what you need, we will do our best to improve support for your language.
* You will get individual support on a continual basis.
* Any new features or tweaks should be available to you without any extra payments.

**Mini-FAQ:**

*But, why not a one-time payment up front instead... ?*<br/>
GTT Booster still has much room for growth. We want to add several more features, and also expand on existing features. Moreover, as the developer of these tools, I really enjoy the process and I would like to continue making it better.

*So, where can I buy it then?*<br/>
Please await further information from relevant channels if applicable to you, or if you represent a vendor with which we are not yet cooperating, then please get in touch <a href="mailto:gttbooster@gmail.com">by e-mail</a> to discuss possible arrangements.
