GTT Booster is a set of tools developed by and for translators. Its aim is to create a more enjoyable, productive and seamless experience while using Google Translator Toolkit.

Its target user is someone who uses GTT most every day. GTT Booster does not try to compete with existing general CAT solutions, but it does aim at being the best companion to GTT and to provide all the convenience features found elsewhere & more.

Its feature set includes automatic language checks, improved spellchecking, and various tweaks and enhancements.

While the product in its current state certainly will benefit the user, additional features are planned for the future.
