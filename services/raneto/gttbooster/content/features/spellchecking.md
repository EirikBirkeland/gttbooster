The QA mode comes with a built-in spellchecker. This spellchecker has at present been tested for about 25 languages. See below for details on your language. If your language is missing from the list, please <a href="mailto:gttbooster@gmail.com">let us know</a> right away!

GTT Booster will attempt to auto-detect the language you are using. This should work for 95% of usage scenario, but if you have special needs, you can just go to the `options screen > Spellcheck` and specify your preferred language.

*************

**Languages that have been tested and experience no issues:**

Afrikaans, Arabic (new), Bengali, Dutch, French, Farsi (new), German, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovene, Spanish, Telugu, Turkic, Zulu (new)

**Not supported, as conventional spellchecking is not possible for these languages:**

Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and other languages that do not usually support spellchecking

**Tamil and Eastern Punjabi:**

The present spellcheck databases for these languages seem to have some limitations. Please let us know if you have any suggestions for how we may improve support for your language. We are already working on expanding support for this language, but please get in touch if you have any requests or suggestions.

**Amharic:**

Based on our research, Amharic does not have a fully standardized orthography, and for this reason the spellchecker may not be very accurate. We are already working on expanding support for this language, but please get in touch if you have any requests or suggestions.

When the spellchecker is active, incorrectly spelled words will have a red wiggle underneath:

By right-clicking the wiggle, you can bring up a context menu and save the word as an exception.
