Click this button to open a new window containing glossaries. The window will be shared between any number GTT tabs you are running. This way, you may example put the window on a separate monitor or keep it in a certain location on your screen.

While GTT already has several glossary facilities, this one is useful for those people who dislike scrolling and mouse hovering: Glossaries should be readily available when we need them, without any fuzz!

Please let us know if you have any suggestions for improvement to fit your needs.

Coming soon:
* Ability to sort glossaries according to custom criteria
* Smart sorting of glossaries
