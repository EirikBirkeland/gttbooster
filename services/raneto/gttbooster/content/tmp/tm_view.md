**Fuzzy indication**

TM matches now have a fuzzy match %.

The colors are determined as follows:

* 0-59% - red
* 60-79% - orange
* 80-100% - blue

**"Toggle" button**

The "Toggle" button next to each glossary item is an optional way to switch between the new and old highlighting.
We are leaving this as-is for now pending more feedback from users on their preferences!
