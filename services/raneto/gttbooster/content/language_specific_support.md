If your language requires special adaptations we are happy to work with you to extend support for your language. We will, naturally, be investigating different languages and their particular needs ourselves, but please do get in touch if you have any suggestions!

When getting in touch, please write in English, Japanese or Norwegian.

Wish you a happy GTT boosting experience.

Yours sincerely,
Eirik Birkeland
