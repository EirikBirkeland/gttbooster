### GTT Booster

GTT Booster is a [free](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) Chrome Extension for Google Translator Toolkit.
Its intended user is a professional translator working with glossaries and other parts of Google's ecosystem. This tool is NOT intended for a general audience in its current state, but you may benefit from some features, so don't be shy to give it a try!

Core functionality may be lacking if you are using this on a non-Google account!

GTT Booster is freely available under the GPL 3.0 or later. You may [download and use the extension from the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translator-toolkit/pjankaakojbendjaejlcnpgeldmfpjed) for any private or commercial purpose.

**HOT TIP**: Type `localStorage['cth-dev-mode'] = true` in your browser console, and you will get some development features that you may find useful ;) These are still being tested, and performance may be impacted slightly.
