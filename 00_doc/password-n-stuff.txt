 - AssassinBug: Meanwhile some guy is living off of chicken and building more muscle faster :)
04:53 - _soniku_: yeah for sure chicken is almost all protein hehe
04:54 - _soniku_: the thing with protein is also that it can get converted to carbs apparently with around 70% efficiancy
04:54 - _soniku_: so if you get 1000 cals of protein and its converted to carbs its aroung 700 cals
04:59 - AssassinBug: Oh, I see
04:59 - AssassinBug: well I had better get to sleep now. Thanks for the chat :) And btw!
05:00 - AssassinBug: This is my 'work' , 'programming' profile :)
05:00 - AssassinBug: https://www.facebook.com/groups/react.native.community/?fref=nf
05:00 - _soniku_: hehe yep was just thinking that it must be super late for you hehe
05:00 - AssassinBug: also can't remember if you're on linkedin, but i'm there also:
05:00 - AssassinBug: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/
05:00 - AssassinBug: oops:
05:00 - AssassinBug: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eirikbirkeland/
05:01 - _soniku_: hehe cool! yeah i should be there as well :) which reminds me i should reply to some ppl on there, thanks! lol
05:02 - _soniku_: if you search for ceda andelkovic on linkedin you should be able to find me easily btw hehe
05:02 - AssassinBug: and yea, if you add me on FB -- i put out some silly programming related things. I don't really have a network on there, but it's gonna be just for career
05:02 - _soniku_: ah hehe okay :)
05:02 - AssassinBug: sent invite on both FB and LinkedIn :)
05:02 - _soniku_: cool thanks! :)
05:03 - _soniku_: have a nice night btw! :)
05:03 - AssassinBug: the nature of FB just depends on whether you join groups. But, not that awesome tbh
05:03 - AssassinBug: I wish FB was linked with real places
05:03 - AssassinBug: Maybe I should hang out in Slashdot forums ... i remember those people were really smart
05:03 - AssassinBug: and maybe just general forums, traditional forums
05:03 - _soniku_: hehe i dont really join groups not relly using fb that much except when i need to chat hehe
05:04 - AssassinBug: yeah it doesn't matter, because most people on FB are not very smart, or do not engage in meaningful debate
05:04 - _soniku_: fb wants to be all encompassing of course lol
05:04 - AssassinBug: more like 5 word comments on their phones lol
05:04 - _soniku_: lol yep or instagram pics
05:04 - AssassinBug: There is nothing preventing smart people to be on FB, but it just seems like idiots scare them away :)
05:04 - AssassinBug: haha eyah
05:05 - _soniku_: lol yeah you just see some posts and then you're like ok enough garbage for the day
05:05 - _soniku_: lol
05:05 - AssassinBug: hahhaha yeah
05:05 - _soniku_: i see some girls like post some quotes lol
05:05 - _soniku_: and they are like all the rest of you that envy me that much are pathetic etc and im like ugh..
05:05 - _soniku_: lol
05:05 - AssassinBug: LOL
05:05 - AssassinBug: it's a very small pond ....
05:06 - _soniku_: lol
05:06 - AssassinBug: I don't consider myself special, but, seriously,
05:06 - _soniku_: then they post a stupid ugly pic with duck lips to go along with the comment lol
05:06 - AssassinBug: I can't learn much from FB. 1 in 1000 are smarter than me. So, I become like the weirdo
05:06 - AssassinBug: I am the 200 iq autistic guy, and you would be too
05:06 - _soniku_: heheh
05:06 - AssassinBug: but then I go to slashdot and I marvel at the experience
05:06 - AssassinBug: or stackoverflow
05:06 - AssassinBug: great people around every corner I can learn from :)
05:07 - AssassinBug: haha yeah it's like a 60 iq shitfest
05:07 - _soniku_: hehe yep :) lots of people spent time learning specific things for hours and then you just pick it up in few minutes hehe
05:07 - _soniku_: from some of those sites hehe so yeah they are good
05:08 - _soniku_: i usually these days follow hacker news hehe
05:09 - AssassinBug: haha yeah
05:10 - AssassinBug: what kinda hacker news do you follow?
05:10 - _soniku_: lol i posted that correctHorseBatteryStaple thing just last month lol
05:10 - _soniku_: oh just ycombinator hehe
05:10 - AssassinBug: hahaha it's so good
05:10 - _soniku_: since this dude believes that having password policies is good lol
05:11 - AssassinBug: Hm but if I know that you are using these kind of passwords, do you know how long it would take me to dictionary crack your passwd?
05:11 - _soniku_: I mean stupid password policies hehe
05:11 - AssassinBug: all those words are common ... top 10 000 words ...
05:11 - _soniku_: you would lock out after 5 attempts
05:11 - _soniku_: lol
05:11 - AssassinBug: is the XKCD thing without flaws?
05:11 - _soniku_: your account
05:11 - AssassinBug: haha that is true!!!
05:12 - AssassinBug: and Google or whoever would send a warning probably
05:12 - AssassinBug: "suspicious logon attempts"
05:12 - _soniku_: its way harder to guess multiply the number of words adjectives etc but anyways hehe
05:12 - AssassinBug: someone trying to brute force with a dictionary
05:12 - AssassinBug: starting like
05:12 - _soniku_: there is rate limiting also lol
05:12 - _soniku_: so you lock out an account and make it wait regardless
05:12 - AssassinBug: yeah
05:12 - AssassinBug: reminds me i haven't added a rate limiter for my system. I will :)
05:13 - _soniku_: hehe yep you can, but think of other things maybe first lol
05:13 - AssassinBug: yea i'm getting close to complete launch and did a bunch of things
05:13 - _soniku_: since you shouldnt worry about rate limiter if you don't have too many users i guess hehe
05:13 - AssassinBug: security is kind of low prio
05:13 - AssassinBug: yeah
05:13 - _soniku_: oh hehe cool :)
05:13 - AssassinBug: if i had 1000 users now i'd be working day and night on security
05:13 - AssassinBug: but it's just getting started so :)
05:13 - _soniku_: hehe yeah
05:13 - _soniku_: even if you get hacked theres not much to compromise lol
05:13 - AssassinBug: When I make my first $1000 I will have a lot of motivation
05:13 - AssassinBug: yeah
05:14 - AssassinBug: my 'authentication' for my software is just like this:
05:14 - _soniku_: hehe that's the spirit :)
05:14 - AssassinBug: the front-end sends a POST request including user name and very little else
05:14 - AssassinBug: so it just says "my name is <email address>"
05:14 - _soniku_: i had a site in a uni with 2 other guys that made like 3500$ a year and i lost the motivation due to their bickering i guess =\ they just couldnt work together after a while
05:14 - AssassinBug: so if that e-mail address is already registered as a vaid user, I send back "true" to the client
05:15 - AssassinBug: then a 'continue to load all the stuff' callback is invoked
05:15 - AssassinBug: and that's it lol
05:15 - AssassinBug: so, wondering, any way i can improve my authentication easily?
05:15 - AssassinBug: I have been thinking to just use Google Auth and similar.
05:15 - AssassinBug: But that could easily take a day, or a week ... sometimes hard to know what libs to use :)
05:15 - _soniku_: your users have passwords hey?
05:15 - AssassinBug: Oh, actually, they don't :)
05:15 - AssassinBug: They never log in
05:16 - _soniku_: lol then there is no security
05:16 - AssassinBug: they just launch their web environment with the account
05:16 - AssassinBug: yes
05:16 - _soniku_: anyone can just put any valid address in there
05:16 - AssassinBug: the front-end simply asks "can i launch now?" to my server
05:16 - _soniku_: what are you using for a server node?
05:16 - AssassinBug: exactly, they can
05:16 - AssassinBug: Node yeah
05:16 - _soniku_: you don't have users yet hey?
05:17 - AssassinBug: Oh, I have 156 'trial users'
05:17 - _soniku_: okay hmm they should have easy auth modules i would guess i know that ruby/rails has easy and simple ones but node should be easy
05:17 - AssassinBug: but basically my system is open :)
05:17 - _soniku_: hehe yeah
05:17 - AssassinBug: When the trial of 10 unique days expires, then my server will start requiring a valid payment object (scanning my MongoDB for any PayPal payments that I've stored)
05:18 - AssassinBug: Hm, ok, so I will just investigate what is being used, and then I'll set up the server-side Node authentication module, and follow instructions for hooking it up client-side?
05:18 - _soniku_: you don't store anything that is personaly identifiable there hey?
05:18 - AssassinBug: But i mean, a normal user would not be able to cheat anything :)
05:19 - _soniku_: yeah i think that should be easiest, i like oauth but lots of people think its too hard and overkill so i would agree
05:19 - AssassinBug: because the client software will check my server to bea ble to proceed
05:19 - AssassinBug: a smart user would just edit the client side code, and avoid the entire authentication module.
05:19 - _soniku_: i mean if you store something like credit card info in your db, yo shouldnt hehe
05:19 - AssassinBug: None of that data is ever sent to the client :)
05:19 - _soniku_: yeah the authentication would be done on the server = )
05:20 - AssassinBug: The client cannot get anything from the server, except something like
05:20 - AssassinBug: "You have 120 days left" :)
05:20 - _soniku_: yeah but im saying what if you get hacked
05:20 - AssassinBug: Oh, yes i don't have any CC numbers.
05:20 - _soniku_: or someone takes over your db hehe
05:20 - AssassinBug: All of that is handled by PP
05:20 - _soniku_: oh hehe good :)
05:20 - AssassinBug: if they take over my DB  well, they can mess with it and confuse my users,
05:20 - AssassinBug: but I keep daily backups, which are synced to 'cloud'
05:21 - AssassinBug: daily backups of entire Mongo record
05:21 - _soniku_: i remember we looked at some code for a popular bakery here and found that they stored the cc info in their db hehe that would be dangerous
05:21 - AssassinBug: Absolutely!
05:21 - _soniku_: hehe okay yeah the way you would do authentication with oauth lets say for example
05:21 - AssassinBug: familiar with PayPal IPN? I store those in my DB
05:21 - _soniku_: ah i didn't use paypal ipn before hehe
05:22 - _soniku_: but anyways with oauth you would take user's password and email then authenticate and server would issue a token if its valid
05:22 - AssassinBug: https://pasteboard.co/8owiSg1Rd.png
05:22 - AssassinBug: This is an entire user record ... all I keep :)
05:22 - _soniku_: then with each api request you would send this token too
05:22 - AssassinBug: then I keep statistics linked to a fairly anonymous end user account like 003-no_0024@003vendor.com
05:22 - AssassinBug: these accounts may have multiple human users, may change over time
05:22 - _soniku_: hehe okay sounds cool :)
05:23 - _soniku_: i like these individual apps hehe i miss making those :)
05:23 - _soniku_: actually might get on and start to code something myself tomorrow hehe :)
05:23 - _soniku_: its the long weekend here also so that's a plus hehe
05:24 - AssassinBug: OK, but do you see any problems with my current setup as follows? 1. everyone in the world get 14 day trial ... I keep a record of the e-mail account they're using in the app. 2. I then simply redirect to my store once they've used 14 days 3. I don't store anything sensitive, just some very basic things, mostly in order to grant/restrict access
05:24 - AssassinBug: a smart end user would rewrite the client-side source code (minified JS, I might obfuscate a little, tho don't think it helps that much)
05:24 - _soniku_: ok so if im the user i can give my email to 1000 buddies hehe
05:24 - _soniku_: or resell for 1$ my email account somewhere
05:25 - _soniku_: and people can't change password to hijack the account etc
05:25 - AssassinBug: Haha then get attacked with 1000 IPs all using the system
05:25 - _soniku_: yeah i mean they can use your system for free
05:25 - _soniku_: i mean aside from that initial transaction
05:25 - AssassinBug: Yeah, I was thinking to add an IP restriction, and similar 'tricks'
05:26 - AssassinBug: in order to enforce "1 simultaneous user"
05:26 - _soniku_: but then what if they connect on their phone and can't access if its ip based
05:26 - AssassinBug: of course, one company may have 10 users with same ...
05:26 - AssassinBug: So, a company in brazil, 20 translators
05:26 - AssassinBug: all using 1 account now lol
05:26 - _soniku_: yeah 1 account, they just need an email
05:26 - _soniku_: yep
05:26 - AssassinBug: to get cheap access
05:26 - _soniku_: or 200 of them lol
05:26 - _soniku_: and they could all be using the same ip over nat
05:26 - _soniku_: lol
05:26 - AssassinBug: Oh yes, so this is why i need those authentication tokens - so called session tokens, right?
05:26 - AssassinBug: Haha
05:27 - AssassinBug: So if Brazilian asshole #1 is using the system, then he will be logged off if Brazilian asshole #2 gets on :)
05:27 - AssassinBug: because the 2nd browser session will ask for a new authentication token ...
05:27 - AssassinBug: and my system will say "hey man, you are using 2 browsers at the same time ... ?"
05:28 - _soniku_: yeah if you wanted to you could do it that way = ) just have one token valid at a time
05:28 - _soniku_: now they could all share this token
05:28 - _soniku_: but it expires in an hour and would be hard to implement for them lol
05:29 - _soniku_: at least harder than just everyone just using a single email
05:29 - _soniku_: basically the thing is that email is the only thing that authenticates stuff
05:29 - _soniku_: and if a user leaves the company lets say and then they don't have the password
05:29 - _soniku_: he can bring that email to another company and they can start using it, etc
05:29 - _soniku_: hehe
05:30 - _soniku_: you can implement rate limiting with just an email too and then say you have exceeded normal usage etc
05:30 - _soniku_: but the problem is that with just an email they have no control later on who else is using it
05:30 - AssassinBug: I have some tricks btw ...
05:31 - _soniku_: then later on if you start to save some data to their user account it can easily go out of their control and become a worldwide account and since they can't change the password or anything hehe
05:31 - AssassinBug: I have access to their client-side hardware, so I can retrieve some info like number of cores, CPU architecture, amount of memory
05:31 - AssassinBug: and use that as a 'fingerprint'
05:31 - AssassinBug: of course, i want to be utmost careful and also not inconvenience users :)
05:31 - _soniku_: arent they allowed to use the application on their mobile phones too?
05:31 - AssassinBug: Yeah, they can use it on mobile too
05:31 - _soniku_: so you need to collect at least 2 of those
05:32 - AssassinBug: and you're right, if that e-mail ends up on the world market ... like "free account warez"
05:32 - _soniku_: yeah hehe
05:32 - AssassinBug: then everyone gets access XD
05:32 - _soniku_: or if they upgrade their memory
05:32 - _soniku_: lol
05:32 - _soniku_: they can't use your app
05:32 - _soniku_: lol and yep
05:32 - AssassinBug: How do you mean collect? Like, to make them happy, i must allow a single user to use 2 phones or something, right?
05:33 - AssassinBug: yeah, I want to avoid doing 'seemingly smart but potentially too restrictive' maneuvers :)
05:33 - _soniku_: i mean since you said you use the memory cpu cores etc as a fingerprint
05:33 - AssassinBug: So, I should aim for robust :)
05:33 - _soniku_: then like if they change their computer they can't login
05:33 - _soniku_: or if they start using a new phone if it's restricted that way
05:33 - _soniku_: hehe
05:33 - AssassinBug: Yeah, or I disconnect their other computers by relying on WebSocket connections
05:34 - _soniku_: so they would have to email you again that might be restricted
05:34 - _soniku_: how would you know its the actual user? would they have to email you?
05:34 - AssassinBug: Feeling a bit panicky about this, but I guess at least some users will be honest, lol
05:34 - AssassinBug: I can't really know
05:34 - _soniku_: hehe i think having to email people is more inconvenience than passwords
05:34 - _soniku_: hehe okay : )
05:34 - _soniku_: yeah hehe
05:35 - AssassinBug: I think I would do this:
05:35 - AssassinBug: - send a password to the purchasing user, ask them to keep it secret
05:35 - AssassinBug: Hm. Starting to feel like a big potential mess lol
05:35 - _soniku_: lol yeah
05:35 - AssassinBug: But kinda fun at the same time
05:36 - AssassinBug: hacker thinking
05:36 - _soniku_: hehe
05:36 - AssassinBug: basicaly a user will go to the shop i showed you, and they will input the mail account they wanna authorize for
05:36 - AssassinBug: then, they will make their PayPal purchase, probably using a different email
05:36 - AssassinBug: If/when I notice if a particular account has been hacked/similar,
05:37 - AssassinBug: I can reissue a password or send a warning "Due to suspicious activity ..."
05:37 - AssassinBug: Anyway, I will easily notice if one account has 'gone crazy' :)
05:37 - AssassinBug: if the activity is beyond that of 1 human user.
05:38 - _soniku_: Hehe okay if that's the way that you want to go with, I would personally just go with a simple rate-limited password hehe
05:38 - AssassinBug: I expect to have less than 500 users the first 6 months (I just don't know)
05:38 - _soniku_: Ah hehe I see
05:38 - AssassinBug: I think what I will do now, is read up everything about oauth, and these tips you have given me
05:38 - AssassinBug: and handle any strange things manually until I decide what to do :)
05:39 - AssassinBug: Rate-limited password ... like:
05:39 - AssassinBug: issue 1 unique password per user account / e-mail address? And then,
05:39 - AssassinBug: limit to X logins per day, or something?
05:40 - _soniku_: oh i mean you can look up twitters rate limiting if you want they have a page on that
05:40 - AssassinBug: I do know how to rate limit, e.g. debouncing :)
05:40 - _soniku_: they have low rate limits lol i think it starts since the time when they were using ruby and then moved to scala from that
05:41 - _soniku_: but that might be overdoing it hehe i would say go with the simplest thing for now but eyah for me if a site doesnt ask me for apssword and asks me to pay i would be suspicious lol
05:41 - _soniku_: a password*
05:41 - AssassinBug: Currently, the end user connects to my /auth route every time they load a webpage/document while using the extension
05:41 - AssassinBug: and that might happen up to 10 times per minute, in some extreme cases
05:41 - AssassinBug: this is because sometimes the user may have 10-40 documents for a single project XD
05:41 - AssassinBug: However! What I can do ... is enter the password authentication at the browser level, instead of on the page level.
05:42 - AssassinBug: So, the user will fire up chrome, and connect/log on at the global browser level.
