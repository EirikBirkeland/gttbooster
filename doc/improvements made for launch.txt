Dear trial users,

GTT Booster is now moving from open testing to sales. We thank you for testing the product, and we hope that you did not experience many issues and that the product has been useful to you. The GTT Booster URL will remain the same, and your existing extension will be updated automatically.

We will continue developing and tweaking this product to further improve the GTT experience, and your support will help us allocate resources towards its continued development.

Next time you start GTT Booster, you will get a 7 day official trial. When this trial expires, you will be redirected to the store page upon launching GTT Booster.
Note: Please do not hesitate to make early purchases - any purchased time will be *added* to your remaining trial days, so you will not be saving anything by waiting for the trial to expire.

When making a single user purchase, please give PayPal a few minutes to process your request. As soon as you receive a payment confirmation from PayPal, your GTT Booster subscription should already have been activated, and you will be able to use the product you purchased.

Support
-------
We answer inquiries within 24 hours (excluding weekends). Please direct all inquiries to gttbooster@gmail.com.

Flexible feature voting!
------------------------
A flexible feature voting screen will be added to the interface. You will be able to flexibly enter your vote for the next feature/tweak/etc. to be added. But naturally, you can still contact us by e-mail separately if we can help you in any way.

This will help set and change priorities flexibly as the product develops in line with the requirements of the users.
