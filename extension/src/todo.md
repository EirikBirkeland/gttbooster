1. Add LSC (Longest Subsegment Concordance) - make it work between documents [later optional]

2. Make cross-document consistency checking:
    1. 100+ documents necessary in some cases, and keeping them all open would crash the browser.
    2. Add button for syncing current project documents. Green indicator to suggest that the syncing is up to date.

3. Change tag representation by adding CSS classes to the tags.

4. Add icons from Detached Glossaries to standard glossary view as well.

5. Change the segment filtering icons to look better, by perhaps changing the scale slightly. Maybe a drop down menu instead, similar to GTT's own.
